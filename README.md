brackens-gregs-wades
====================
This is a modification of the Gregs-Wades-Hinged-Accessible Extruder source.

It includes the removable captive hinged idler idea from the Eckertech i2, The idler is my re-design to make it strong enough, I have re-designed starting from the gregs source.

It's still accessible, but in a different way (complete) removal of the idler.

I have included all the needed sources from https://github.com/josefprusa/PrusaMendel as the licenses are all compatible.
